# ShiftOS 0.0.x - Original Game Code

This is the original game's codebase, recovered from Alkaline Thunder's personal archive. This code is of 0.0.9, 
the version of the game that had only one alpha release.

This codebase is written in Visual Basic .NET and Windows Forms, and the solution file was probably last opened 
in Visual Studio Express 2013 for Desktop. Either that or Community 2015. In either case, you might get prompts 
complaining about an old solution file.

There's a challenge with this if you feel like it - try and clean this code. It's very smelly. If you can 
somehow even look at it without developing tension-induced repetitive strain injury, congrats. You're a God.
